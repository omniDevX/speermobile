# Storm Chaser App Crash Fix Guide

## Problem
The app works perfectly in Expo Go but crashes immediately (闪退) after installation from Google Play Store.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Database Initialization Issues**
- Database service was throwing errors during initialization
- No graceful fallback when database fails to initialize
- **Fixed**: Added error handling and graceful degradation

### 2. **Location Permission Handling**
- Immediate location requests on app startup
- No fallback when permissions are denied
- **Fixed**: Added default location and better error handling

### 3. **Missing Error Boundaries**
- No error boundaries to catch and handle crashes
- **Fixed**: Added comprehensive error boundaries

### 4. **Network/API Issues**
- Immediate API calls on startup without proper error handling
- **Fixed**: Added delays and better error handling

## Changes Made

### 1. **App.tsx Improvements**
- Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
- Added app initialization with database setup
- Added loading and error states
- Graceful error handling for initialization failures

### 2. **Database Service (database.ts)**
- Added initialization state tracking
- Graceful error handling - no more throwing errors
- Fallback behavior when database is unavailable
- Updated to match actual type definitions

### 3. **Location Service (locationService.ts)**
- Added timeout and error handling
- Default location fallback when permissions denied
- Check for location services availability
- Graceful degradation instead of throwing errors

### 4. **Weather Hook (useWeather.ts)**
- Delayed initial weather fetch (1 second delay)
- Better error handling without throwing
- Changed initial loading state to false

### 5. **Error Boundary Component**
- Created dedicated ErrorBoundary component
- Better error reporting and recovery
- Development mode error details

### 6. **EAS Build Configuration**
- Added production environment variables
- Better build configuration

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Local Testing**
```bash
# Test the app locally first
npm start
# Test in Expo Go
# Test with EAS build preview
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 2. **Production Build Testing**
```bash
# Create production build
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### 3. **Installation Testing**
- Install the APK on a clean device
- Test with location permissions denied
- Test with airplane mode (no network)
- Test with different Android versions

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Add Crash Reporting**
Consider adding crash reporting tools:
- Sentry for React Native
- Firebase Crashlytics
- Expo's built-in error reporting

### 2. **Add Analytics**
Track app usage and crashes:
- Firebase Analytics
- Expo Analytics

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with basic functionality
- Add features progressively
- Graceful degradation for all features

### 4. **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] App starts without location permissions
- [ ] App works offline
- [ ] Database errors don't crash app
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors
- [ ] App can recover from errors

## Debugging Production Issues

### 1. **Enable Debug Logs**
Add more console.log statements for debugging:
```typescript
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('Debug info:', data);
}
```

### 2. **Add Error Tracking**
```typescript
try {
  // risky operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  // Send to crash reporting service
}
```

### 3. **Test Different Scenarios**
- Fresh install
- Update from previous version
- Different device manufacturers
- Different Android versions
- Different network conditions

## Common Production Issues

### 1. **Permission Issues**
- Location permissions
- Camera permissions
- Storage permissions

### 2. **Device-Specific Issues**
- Different screen sizes
- Different Android versions
- Different manufacturer customizations

### 3. **Network Issues**
- Slow connections
- Intermittent connectivity
- Firewall restrictions

### 4. **Storage Issues**
- Low storage space
- Corrupted app data
- Database corruption

## Next Steps

1. **Build and Test**: Create a new production build with these fixes
2. **Monitor**: Watch for crashes in Google Play Console
3. **Iterate**: Make additional fixes based on crash reports
4. **Optimize**: Continue improving error handling and user experience

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert to previous working version
2. Implement fixes incrementally
3. Test each change thoroughly
4. Use staged rollout in Google Play Console
